# Brainstorming ideas

# Bike Community Outreach Feedback
* Ask local biker communities what they would like to see 
* What problems they deal with when biking concerning safety?
* How do you find your bike route?
* Facebook group can test out the app and provide additional feedback

# API for 

    - Perhaps look for similar APIs to do something with the data 

* Traffic accidents in a location 
* Google maps bike routes -- improving on these somehow 
* API for bike lanes and future bike lane construction planned

# Ideas 

* Biker rating system for bike routes
* Visualize areas of high bike accidents
* Rating a bike route 
    - areas prone accident areas 
    - bicyclist rated as dangerous 
    - bike lane present what percentage of the route 
    - traffic lights 
    - stop signs 
    - lighting
    - high crime area danger for bicyclist and bike storage 
    - scenic view quality 
    - rating route based on time of day and traffic congestion main street or side street?
    - elevation
