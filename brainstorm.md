* Traffic accidents in a location 
* Google maps bike routes -- improving on these somehow 
* API for bike lanes and future bike lane construction planned

# Ideas 

* Biker rating system for bike routes
* Visualize areas of high bike accidents
* Rating a bike route 
    - areas prone accident areas 
    - bicyclist rated as dangerous 
    - bike lane present what percentage of the route what type of bike lane protected? narrow or wide?
    - traffic lights 
    - stop signs 
    - lighting
    - high crime area danger for bicyclist and bike storage 
    - scenic view quality 
    - rating route based on time of day and traffic congestion main street or side street?
    - elevation 
    - predicted time

* Product features
        - What might the product have?
    * Biker can store routes
    * Visualize different routes and have them scored?
    * Bikers can share routes
